# ld-post-purchase-revamp
Prototype of a potential post-purchase ui. Goals include make Edit mode easier to understand. Provide checklist functionality.

The Edit mode of the post-purchase has some UX issues. It's not clear that a duplicate document will be made after the user clicks Edit > Text Editor. To resolve the issue, an animated dialog box explains the functionality.

For the checklist, additional collapsing occurs when screen goes to mobile.
